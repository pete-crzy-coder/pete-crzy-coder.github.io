# The Beggining
***This is the first fully free, non-ad-ed platform for hacks and soon, sharing hacks.***
This was made by a hacker, me/CrazyComputer.
It contains hacks for Mathsonline (The first EVER! by me!), Blooket (Credits to the [Blooket Council](https://github.com/Blooket-Council)), TypingClub (No availible credit, just remember it's not by me), and some other bits and bobs ðŸ˜Š (mostly by me). (This is going to change once we got a Domain Name && a working hack sharing server)

## Who am I?
Iâ€™m a freelance hacker who hacks school websites(for now!).
